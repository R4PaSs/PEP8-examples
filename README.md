# PEP8-demo

This page is used as repository for all PEP-8 related material used in demonstrations for INF2170 given at the `Université du Québec À Montréal`.

All text is redacted in English as it is de facto a universal language, anyone interested in the PEP-8 assembly language is encouraged to look at the material of the subfolders of this repository and clone it for personal experimentation.

If any material is deemed missing, please submit an issue explaining your demands, and I'll try to fix it ASAP.

Should you find an error in any program available on the repo, you're encouraged to submit a Pull-Request with your fixes and an explanation of the errors.

Should you want to modify the programs available on this repository, feel free to do so, they're under the Apache 2 license and can be modified as you wish.
